# SOLID Principles

## **S**ingle Responsibility

An object should only have one and only one responsibility. Think of how changes to that object will effect the rest of the application. The goal is to have minimal to no effect on other object making it easy to change in the future.

## **O**pen Closed

An object should be open for extension but closed for modification. Less modification of the orginal object leads to more stability but still allows for extension.

## **I**nterface Segregation
