* Promotes continuous integration and delivery
* Easier to test (when implemented correctly)
* Works great with Docker and Kubernetes
* Scalable
* Enables Agile development

## Summary

As with every other architecture out there, there is no silver bullet and microservices is no exception. The Microservices architectures has many drawbacks ranging from added deployment complexity to testing which should be taken into consideration during the planning phases of your project. With that said it is still a great choice for complex, evolving applications despite drawbacks and implementation challenges.
